            <h3>Oologah, OK Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Oologah is a town in Rogers County, Oklahoma, United States. Renowned humorist Will Rogers was born on a ranch two miles east of Oologah, although he usually claimed Claremore as his birthplace 'because nobody but an Indian can pronounce 'Oologah.'' There has been disagreement about the proper spelling for the town name. The official spelling is now Oologah. It was often spelled Oolagah before statehood, and this spelling appears on some old buildings.</p>
